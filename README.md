</div>

A super simple oscillator module (avalanche vco) in eurorack format based the designs of [Look Mum No Computer](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/simplest-oscillator) and [kassutronics](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2018/07/avalance-vco.html).
This project is build with the opensource EDA [faerbyk](https://github.com/faebryk/faebryk).

## What can you do with this project?

You can use this project in various ways.
You can use it:
